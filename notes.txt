Programming paradigm

Functional Programming
- Higher order, Immuutability

two type of Function
- invoking
- Reference

Procedural programming
- algorithms and data managing

Object-oriented Programming
- Easily to understand 

Object oriented Design (is not replaceable)
- Important in programming

objects and classes ():
instance of a class (object) (An object is called an object because you put a value in it)
blueprint (class)

what is your object design

design pattern - preference of the design
two types of assosiation 

agrigation
composition

interact between classes

system divide 

We have two OOD & DSA (Data structure )

logical
- data structure and algorithm

three classification to remember
encapsulation (hiding information from the user)  ex. self.__first_name
polymorphism
inheritance

constructor are the method in a class
required parameters or positional parameters (type annotation)
#attributes

return annotation (not important in code but important in documentation)

and whe have methods (basically functiuons)
-envoking or referencing

Type inference - when a variable is returning to the method. (for example when return value of an integer returning to the method is called type inference)

dynamic - meaning the variable can be interchangeable

attributes into a new value
messy code(because it not pretty to look at (reasons that it is not readable, clarity)) (it must be readable)
{ Property decorator
@property (allow to acces methods as attributes) 😍😍😍

@name.setter
} Why we do this is to not be crowded in code

When getter there is always a return value ()

Since the method, is already a @property decorator then it is already an attribute therefore it does not need a value parameter
since the method is already an attribute then you can change the value

assosiation (reference)
- interaction between classes and methodes.

A class can be associated with another class (composition) 😡😡😡

def __init__(self, damage: str, monster: Monster)
You can reference the monster class into the player class

implementation (method within class is called implementation)
instruction (outside of the class )()

-- association is bad practice so need --
Inheritance
- class is directly associated to other classes (parent and class)
- they are used to make the code readable

implementation is still working but readability to other programmers is bad

Polymorphism (function calling)
criteria: when the Inheritance 
- Override (attributes and methods in a different class can be changed)
- overload 

structural programming language (mostly used in data base)
pascal

👍👍👍👍👍
Dart programming language -> Supported Object oriented programming language and its concept. 

web development is used in java script
JavaScirpt (Prototype based classification language) (for user experience)

criteria for OOP
inheritance
supported encapsulation
supported polymorphism

Dart Programming language 🎯🎯🎯🎯🎯
- general-purpose programming language
- created by google
Follows an Object-Oriented programming approach (inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism)
-statically Typed (data type or value that cannot be changed and not dynamic)
Dart mixture of c++ and Java.

Undefined variables
Undeclared variables
initialization (declared a variable the you initiate it)

'var' is when you dont want to specify the datatype of a variable. (Type Inference)

void main() {
  String name = 'Christian';
  print(name);
  int x = 5;
  double p1 = 3.13;
  bool isOpen = true;
  print(isOpen);
  var last_name = 'Gadiano';
}

User defined datatype

void main() {
  List<> arr_example = [20, 30, 'hello'];
  var arr = [20, 30, 40, 75, 'name'];
  print(arr);
  print(arr_example); 
}

void main() {
  List<int> scores = [20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70];

                                None value so you can put anything you want 👍
                                ^^^^^
  for (int score in scores.where((x) => x >= 30)) {
        print('${score}');
  }
}

dart is null safety which means that it cannot put datatypes without variables unless you put and optional symbol?
ex.
{
int? x;
print(x);
}

Functions (required)
void Main (is a function)

void main() {
  print(greet());
}

String greet() {
  return 'hello';
}

Name arguments or named parameters

void main() {
  print(greet(age: 20,name: 'Christian'));
  print(greet2('Christian', 20));
}

// Name parameters 👍👍👍👍
String greet({required String name,required int age}) {
  return 'I am ${name}, and I am ${age} years old';
}

//positional Parameters 👎👎👎👎👎
String greet2(String name, int age) {
  return 'I am ${name}, and I am ${age} years old 😒';
}

//Positional Parameters
void main() {
//   user defined datatype
  Student student = Student('John', 'Soul', 'BSCS', '2nd year');
  print(student.fullName());
//   or is do not know then var student = Student();
}

class Student{
  String? firstName;
  String? lastName;
  String? course;
  String? yearLevel;
  
  //attribute first before constructor
  Student(this.firstName, this.lastName, this.course, this.yearLevel);
  
  //Method
  String fullName() {
    return '${firstName} ${lastName}';
  }
}

//Name Parameters
void main() {
//   user defined datatype 🎯🎯🎯
  Student student = Student(yearLevel: '2nd year', firstName: 'John',lastName: 'Soul',course: 'BSCS');
  print(student.fullName());
//   or is do not know then var student = Student(); 
}

class Student{
  String? firstName;
  String? lastName;
  String? course;
  String? yearLevel;
  
  //attribute first before constructor
  Student({required this.firstName,required this.lastName,required this.course,required this.yearLevel});
  
  //Method
  String fullName() {
    return '${firstName} ${lastName}';
  }
}
